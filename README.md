# 1ari-mp - *"Jefferson Disk"*

## Synopsis

This repository contains the work done for a SUPINFO school project where
students were asked to code a cipher system, the [Jefferson Disk], in Python
and Pygame for the graphical user interface.  
Being a group project, it involved two persons:
 * DOURNEAU Pierre-Louis ([@pldiiw])
 * Cl√©ment GRIMAUD ([@ehrakis])

## Installation

Requires Python 3.5+ and Pygame.

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pldiiw/1ari-mp.git

Then run the GUI:

    python3 src/JeffersonGUI.py

## Tests

There's a test suite inside the `test/` directory.

To run it, just execute the test script:

    ./run_tests.sh

It requires mypy. If don't have it, just run:

    pip3 install mypy-lang

## Project Hierarchy

All source files can be found in the `src/` directory.  
Tests are under the `test/` directory.

## Code guidelines

### PEP-8

Coding conventions are important to keep the code base clean. We followed the
guidelines defined in the [PEP-8]. [YAPF] helped us reach this goal without
headaches, and by saving a lot of time.

### Function annotations

[Function annotations] is a new language feature introduced in Python 3.5. It
can be used to explicitly type function parameters and variables. Along with
[Mypy], it helped us avoid bugs ahead of runtime, sketch the _flow_ of the code
and easily understand and share function type signatures.

## Tools used

### Git

Sharing code and combining with the work of others can be an intricate process.
Git hugely facilitates this by providing the appropriate tools to get a more
organized workflow and keep track of our advancement.

### YAPF

[YAPF] is a code formatter for Python that goes further than others linting
tools. It totally rearrange the code to get a consistent code style, following
a given style guide, like the PEP-8.

### Isort

[Isort] is a little utility that alphabetically sort imports and seperate them
into sections, making imports more readable and pleasent. Alongside YAPF, it
pushes even further the concept of a consistent code style.

## Notes on function naming

The functions and procedures names asked in the subject differ a bit from the
ones we wrote. We chose to slightly modify the naming to have a codebase
matching the PEP-8 closer and having more expressive names, resulting in more
readable code.

Here's a corresponding table with on the left the subroutine
name in the subject and on the right the matching name inside our code:

| Name in the subject | In the actual code                      |
|--------------------:|:----------------------------------------|
| convertLetters      | sanitize_message                        |
| mix                 | generate_disk                           |
| createCylinder      | write_cylinder_to_file                  |
| loadCylinder        | load_cylinder_from_file                 |
| KeyOK               | is_key_valid                            |
| createKey           | generate_key                            |

## Questions

The following sections contains the answers to the questions which are in the
[subject](subject.pdf).

### _Decipher the text_ `GRMYSGBOAAMQGDPEYVWLDFDQQQZXXVMSZFS` _with the cylinder inside the_ [`cylinder-example.txt`](cylinder-example.txt) _file and the key_ `[12, 16, 29, 6, 33, 9, 22, 15, 20, 3, 1, 30, 32, 36, 19, 10, 35, 27, 25, 26, 2, 18, 31, 14, 34, 17, 23, 7, 8, 21, 4, 13, 11, 24, 28, 5]`.

The unencrypted message was : "The quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog".

### _Encrypt a text of your choice with a cylinder and a key of your choice. Attach them to your project._

If we encrypt the text "Hello world" with the cylinder contained in the file
[`cylinder-question.txt`](cylinder-question.txt) and the key `[8, 4, 6, 7, 2,
1, 10, 5, 3, 9]` we end up with this encrypted message : 'XNUEDNRCHN'.

### _What do you think of the security of this algorithm?_

When exchanging a message using this algorithm, you have also the key
and the disks to give. Communicating a key is common to many encryption
algorithms, but having another factor to carry, the cylinder, is one more
failure spot.

The first weak point of any encryption system using a unique key
is exchanging that key: if you encrypt your message, it is therefore that
you're afraid of being read by someone else than your peer ; then how can you
accept to exchange a key if your communication channel is insecure?

Having the cylinder to also exchange is one more handshake to give. It can seen
as more secure, as if your key leaks the theft cannot decrypt the message in
any way. But if your cylinder leaks, it is another scenario. The third party
has a lot more chance of decrypting your message. He has just to try all the
possible permutations of disks, or `n!` for `n` disks. For short messages, is
it easy to test all the possible keys. The longer the message the harder it is.

Before computers, messages above 6 characters were starting to be very hard to
decrypt without the key. 6 characters long messages are already hard to
decipher by hand, there's 720 possible keys. Now that we have machines with
heavy computational power we can decrypt way longer messages without having the
key in a reasonable time.

### _What are the main qualities and downsides of this algorithm?_

This algorithm requires no mathematic knowledge for the sender and the
recipient to use it, this must have been quite convenient in the 1800s where
the average mathematic skills were way lower than the ones someone of our
century might have.

What's less convenient about this ciphering system is that is it quite
cumbersome to setup and use. You have to exchange the message, the key and the
cylinder in order to be able to decrypt the former. That's too much
information about our message.

### _How many keys there is in a cylinder of_ `n` _disks?_

This is a permutation without repetition, therefore there is `n!` possible keys
for `n` given disks.
